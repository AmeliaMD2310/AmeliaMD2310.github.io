                    The Rottweiler we know today descends from mastiffs that lived in the Roman Empire more than 2,000 years ago. These rugged dogs accompanied Roman legions north through the Alps, since these soldiers were on their way to invade what’s now Switzerland. Along the way, ancestors of the Rottweiler helped move cattle that was intended to be eaten or eventually sold, and kept the livestock safe from predators and thieves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Romans frequently stopped in what is now Rottweil, Germany, a significant center for livestock trade in the south. The city gets its modern name from its red roof tiles, but in ancient times, it was known as Arae Flaviae. After the Roman Empire collapsed, Rottweilers became valuable working companions in this part of Germany. They herded livestock in butchers’ yards, and would pull heavy carts full of meat to market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the sale, a “drover,” someone who moves livestock, often placed the money in a purse around the dog’s neck. One look at this proud, protective breed might have made potential robbers think twice. Soon, the dog became known as the “Rottweiler Metzgerhund,” or “Butcher’s Dog of Rottweil.” Over the centuries, the breed was crossed with other developing breeds, such as the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, the Bernese Mountain Dog, the Entlebucher Mountain Dog, and the Appenzeller Sennenhund.

                    The Rottweiler breed almost went extinct in the mid-1800s. This was the time of railroad proliferation, making the transport of livestock easier and lessening the need for drover and herding dogs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As railroads became the primary method for moving stock to market, the need for the breed declined, as did the number of Rottweilers. The number of Rottweilers diminished so severely that by 1882 in a dog show in Heilbronn, there was only one very poor representative of the breed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The breed almost vanished entirely, but a small group of breeders fought hard to keep them around. In the 20th century, the breed found a new purpose serving in the military and on police forces. Rottweilers were introduced to the United States in 1910 where their popularity continued to grow.

                    In the early 20th century, the German Police Dog Association began employing Rottweilers, German Shepherd Dogs, Doberman Pinschers, and Airedale Terriers as police dogs. Rottweilers also found jobs pulling heavy carts for workers and protecting private properties and businesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, people realized this brave breed would make a loyal household companion. In 1930, a German immigrant to the United States named Otto Denny bred the first Rottweiler litter. At the time, the puppies were registered with a German-based breed club, as the American Kennel Club did not yet recognize the breed. The AKC added a Rottweiler to its stud book in 1931, and the breed became a member of the Working Group. The Rottweiler’s AKC breed standard was initially published in 1935, then revised in 1971 and 1990.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the mid-1990s, the passion for the breed soared as more people learned about the dogs’ affectionate but watchful nature. Rottweiler clubs flourished, with over a thousand international member organizations. At one point, the Rottweiler ranked as the second-most popular breed in the U.S.
