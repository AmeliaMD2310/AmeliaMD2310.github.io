                    Rottweilers are confident dogs. They understand how strong they are, and they don’t usually need reassurance. Rottweilers are less likely to be afraid of things that many dogs are afraid of, like thunderstorms. 

                    They often remain aloof in situations that other breeds would find stressful. It takes a lot to get under their skin and rattle their nerves. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the Rottweiler’s large stature, they’re usually big babies. Most of the time, your Rottweiler will just want to love you. They’ll stay by your side, hoping to play, snuggle, and have fun. 

                    If you’ve worked closely with your adult Rottweiler as a dog owner from the time they were a puppy, you’ll form a strong lifelong bond. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every living thing has a “fight or flight” instinct. When faced with something that feels threatening, people and animals will either choose to rise to the challenge or abandon the situation. 

                    Your Rottweiler will choose to fight, but only after assessing the situation and deeming something a threat. 

                    Your Rottweiler may be curious about strangers or other dogs and remain suspicious until they’ve assessed the situation. If your Rottweiler can tell that you’re panicked or uncomfortable, they’re more likely to jump to your defense. 

                    This is why Rottweilers are often used as guard dogs, watchdogs, or cattle dogs. They know it’s their job to protect the people they love, and they won’t hesitate. This is why it is important to focus on early socialization and dog training for your Rottweiler puppy.

                    Rottweilers are an intelligent dog breed due to many reasons. Their smartness attributes them to be great learners. They are known for their obedience in comparison to other dog breeds. Their instinctive intelligence helps them in being fantastic guard dogs and loyal companions. They are always on alert and can identify threats. They have good adaptive skills, if not great. With training, you can help them develop it better. They are intelligent learners and can comprehend commands quickly as taught.

                    Rottweiler is a fantastic friend, and their playful nature brings joy to the owner. Simultaneously, their protective instinct makes you trust him or her easily in case of danger.

                <p>
                    Rottweiler are amazing guard dogs and can be fiercely protective of the ones they love, while also being goofy, fun-loving clowns who can make amazing family dogs. They often have no real sense of “personal space” and love nothing more than getting as close to you as possible for ALL the cuddles (often trying to be a lap dog, despite their size!). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    They’ll also body slam things without seeming to notice, which can lead to them accidentally bowling over small kids or dogs when they’re excited. Rottweilers were bred to herd and protect cattle, so they have an interesting mix of traits that can affect their behaviour. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The herding side means that they’re often attracted to movement, and love chasing things (including inappropriate things like bikes!), while the guarding side means they can be protective, strong and sometimes aggressive without the right training. All of these traits of the rottweiler temperament mean that training rottweilers properly is super important, so that you can guide them on what is and isn’t appropriate behaviour, in a way that they both understand and listen to, even when they really want to do something else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our human world doesn’t always make much sense to our dogs, so proper training means you can train a rottweiler to understand the difference between an intruder, and the postman, as well as teach them self-control so that their goofball enthusiasm, lack of awareness around “personal space”, and large size doesn’t make them a hazard for the people and dogs around them (especially kids!). Rottweilers can sometimes get a bad rap (ever noticed that they’re often the “bad/scary” dog in a lot of old movies?), and many people are nervous of such a large, intimidating looking dog. In reality though, a well-trained Rottweiler is a gorgeous, steady, trustworthy dog, who knows both how to behave and be calm when required, as well as cut loose and have fun when appropriate.
